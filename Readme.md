  <span> This Repository contains all the notes and the code executions with detailed explanations for the codes and the theoretical implementations. In future I'll hook in the codes along with the explanations in my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jayasoruban1112/">Instagram</a> **stories**, which I'll also post here.

From Basic to Advanced Refresh your Python implementations of Leetcodes with theoretical addons.
